Create a single, dynamic "Join as Artisan" page using EJS, Tailwind CSS, and inline JavaScript. The page should provide users with two clear, distinct options for joining the platform: a free "Standard Listing" and a paid "Verified Artisan" application.

Key Requirements:

Technology Stack:

The entire page must be a single EJS file.

All styling must be implemented using Tailwind CSS utility classes directly in the HTML structure. Do not use a separate CSS file or <style> tags.

All functionality must be handled by an inline <script> tag at the bottom of the EJS file using vanilla JavaScript.

Layout & Structure:

The page should have a clean, modern, two-column layout for the main choices, which collapses to a single column on smaller screens (mobile-first design).

Implement two distinct "choice cards": one for the "Standard Listing (Free)" and one for the "Verified Artisan (Paid)".

Below these cards, create two corresponding forms. The forms should be hidden by default and only appear when the user clicks the button on the corresponding card.

Styling & Aesthetics (Tailwind CSS):

The overall aesthetic must be elegant and modern, using a black and gold color palette.

Use a dark background (e.g., bg-gray-900 or bg-black).

Use gold shades for primary buttons, borders, headings, and accents (e.g., bg-yellow-500, border-yellow-500, text-yellow-500).

The "Verified Artisan" card must be visually emphasized to make it more appealing (e.g., with a glowing border, a "Recommended" badge, or a slightly larger size).

Content & Forms:

Standard Listing (Free) Card: Should clearly state it's free and list simple benefits (e.g., "Get listed quickly," "Appear in search results").

Verified Artisan (Paid) Card: Should list premium benefits (e.g., "Higher search preference," "Verified badge," "Build client trust").

Standard Form: A simple form with fields for Full Name, Skill/Trade, Location, and Phone Number. The form should POST to /api/join/unverified.

Verified Form: A more comprehensive form with fields for Full Name, Email, Phone Number, Skill/Trade, Location, Years of Experience, a textarea for a brief bio, and a file input for document uploads. This form must have enctype="multipart/form-data" and POST to /api/join/verified.

Functionality (JavaScript):

Implement a tab-like system. When a user clicks the button on either the "Free" or "Verified" card, the corresponding form below should become visible, and the other form should be hidden.

The active choice card's button should change its style to indicate it is selected.

The experience should be seamless, with no page reloads.

(Optional but preferred) Add basic client-side validation to check that required fields are not empty before form submission.
