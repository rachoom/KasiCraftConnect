I tried to create the explicit view you provided:

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW public.artisans_with_featured AS SELECT id, first_name, last_name, email, phone, location, services, description, years_experience, rating, review_count, verified, subscription_tier, approval_status, verification_status, profile_image, portfolio, password, google_id, id_document, qualification_documents, company_registration, admin_notes, approved_by, approved_at, rejection_reason, is_email_verified, email_verification_token, email_verification_expires, last_login, profile_complete, created_at, updated_at, is_featured FROM public.artisans;

Result: ERROR — Postgres reports column "is_featured" does not exist.

What this means

The database engine can't find a column named is_featured on public.artisans in the current search path/schema accessible to the session. Even though you previously said the column exists, the DB metadata shows it does not (or it's in a different schema / spelled differently / has a different type or name).
Recommended next checks (pick any/all and I'll run them)

Confirm artisans table columns (I can run this now)
I'll list columns for public.artisans to verify exact column names and casing: SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name = 'artisans' ORDER BY ordinal_position; If you want me to run this, I will.
Search for is_featured across all schemas (in case it's on a different table or schema) SELECT table_schema, table_name, column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE column_name = 'is_featured'; I can run this to find any occurrence of that column.

Possible causes to consider

Column exists but in a different schema (not public.artisans).
Column name has different casing or characters (e.g., "is_Featured" or surrounding quotes).
The migration that added the column ran in a different DB connection/schema (e.g., under another schema name).
The column was added after your connection/session; a concurrent transaction might hide it.
You may be connected as a role that can't see the column (unlikely for information_schema queries).
Next step (recommended)

Let me run check #1 and #2 to confirm actual column names and locate is_featured. Confirm and I'll execute both queries and summarize results.

un check #1 and #2 to confirm actual column names and locate is_featured.




Reasoned
I'll run two metadata queries: (1) list columns for public.artisans, and (2) search all schemas for a column named is_featured. I'll execute them separately and validate results.

list_artisans_columns




SELECT column_name, data_type, ordinal_position FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name = 'artisans' ORDER BY ordinal_position;


Reasoned
search_is_featured



SELECT table_schema, table_name, column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE column_name = 'is_featured';

Success. No rows returned

Results
I ran both metadata checks.

Columns on public.artisans
The artisans table columns were listed. is_featured is NOT present in the result set. The last column returned is updated_at (ordinal_position 33).
Search for is_featured across the database
No rows returned — no column named is_featured exists in any schema according to information_schema.
Conclusion and next steps

The column is_featured does not exist in your database (or at least not with that exact name/casing). That's why the view creation failed and PostgREST reports the column missing.
If you expected the column to exist, it may not have been created, or the migration failed, or it was created under a different name.
Options to proceed (pick one)

If you want the column added now, I can run an ALTER TABLE to add it (please confirm the desired type and default). For example, commonly: ALTER TABLE public.artisans ADD COLUMN is_featured boolean DEFAULT false; Confirm if that's acceptable.
If the column should have different type or default (e.g., integer rank, timestamp), tell me the type and default.
If the column was created in another schema or table, provide details and I will search more broadly or adjust.
Alternatively, if you don't want to add the column, I can create the view without that column or with a placeholder (e.g., NULL::boolean AS is_featured) so PostgREST can use it immediately. Example: CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW public.artisans_with_featured AS SELECT ..., NULL::boolean AS is_featured FROM public.artisans; Say "Create placeholder view" if you want that.
What would you like me to do next?

I say let's rather add the column, because it clearly does not exit

Plan
I'll add the missing column is_featured to public.artisans. This is an ALTER TABLE (destructive only in that it modifies the schema) — confirm the type and default below. If you don't respond, I'll add it as a boolean with default FALSE, which is the most common choice for a "featured" flag.

Please confirm one of the following:

"Add boolean default false" — I'll run: ALTER TABLE public.artisans ADD COLUMN is_featured boolean DEFAULT false;
Or provide a different type/default, e.g. "Add boolean default true" or "Add integer default 0" or "Add timestamp" etc.
Or say "Add boolean nullable" to add it without a default: ALTER TABLE public.artisans ADD COLUMN is_featured boolean;
Once you confirm, I'll execute the ALTER TABLE and then recreate the explicit view for you.
