ATTENTION REPLIT CODER: This is a final, urgent mandate. The failure to implement the core visual requirements after repeated instructions has resulted in a non-functional and frustrating user experience. The persistent visual bugs MUST be rectified immediately.

1. CRITICAL FAILURE: VISUAL AESTHETIC & CONTRAST (Absolute Priority)
The site's intended look (the view currently seen when your system's Dark Mode is ON) must be the permanent, default theme for all users, regardless of their system settings.

Aesthetic Enforcement: YOU MUST FORCE THE DARK THEME across the entire application using explicit CSS. The background must be pure black/dark grey, and ALL TEXT must be high-contrast white or gold.

Visibility Failure Fix:

ALL TEXT on the site that is currently low-lighted or invisible in Normal Mode (including on Artisan Profiles, Service Search pages, and the main hero headings) MUST be changed to a highly visible color (Gold or White).

The "Far East Rand" descriptor in the header is invisible in Normal Mode. This MUST be visible (Gold/White).

2. CRITICAL UI & FUNCTIONAL BUGS (Must Be Fixed)
Broken Link Fix: The "Painters" service card (and any others leading to a 404 Page Not Found error) must be fixed to route correctly to its respective Service & Filter Page.

Text Overlap Fix: On the Service Search pages, the text inside the "Select date (optional)" box in the header is overlapping the text below it. Adjust the layout/padding to prevent this overlap.

3. Styling and Layout Corrections
Filter Text Color: The dropdown text and background for "Filter by service" and "Filter by status" must use gold text for high contrast.

Profile Button Visibility: The text on the "View Details" button (or similar profile action buttons) is currently invisible. Change the button text color to white or gold.

Status Tag Color: The status tag (e.g., "Approved") on profile cards must have a prominent green background.

Hero Section Overlay: The image in the hero section must have a darker overlay to ensure the white and gold text is clearly readable.

Icon Enhancement: Replace all generic icons (e.g., house, wrench) with aesthetically enhanced, professional icons that use the site's gold/yellow accent color.
